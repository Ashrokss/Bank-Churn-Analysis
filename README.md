## Imbalanced Learning

### Undersampling

This section discusses the use of undersampling techniques to handle class imbalance in the bank churn dataset. It involves reducing the number of majority class instances to balance the dataset.

### Oversampling

In this section, oversampling techniques are used to handle class imbalance by increasing the number of minority class instances to match the majority class.

## Evaluation

### Undersampling Data Evaluation

This section evaluates the performance of models trained on the undersampled dataset. Various metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of the models.

## Conclusions

### Insights

This section provides key insights derived from the analysis and evaluation of the models.

### Model Performance

A detailed performance summary of the models is provided, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in predicting customer churn.

### Actionable Recommendations

Based on the analysis and insights, actionable recommendations are provided to help the bank reduce customer churn and improve retention strategies.
